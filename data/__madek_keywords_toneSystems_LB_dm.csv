12-tet 912-tone equal temperament system. This is the most widely and commonly used tuning system in Western music. The system divides the octave into twelve equal spaces of 100 cents between the half-tones. 
53-tet 4Tone system dividing the octave into 53 equal steps. It had first been described by Chinese theorist Jing Fang (78-37 BC) and later by Nicholas Mercator (1620-1687), Isaac Newton (1643-1727) and William Holder (1616-1698). This tuning system approximates the Pythagorean fifth and the just major third.
58-tet 1Tone system dividing the octave into 58 equal steps
59-tet 1Tone system dividing the octave into 59 equal steps
Aristoxenus 1Aristoxenos of Tarent, Greek mathematician and music theorist (ca. 360-300 B.C.). Greatly influenced terminology in music theory with many terms still used today. In his writings, he advocated an empirical approach in music theory, drawing strongly on listening.
arithmetic mean 1Generally a mean value calculated by dividing the sum of all the numbers in a collection by the number of numbers. 
ars nova 1The term Ars nova originally relates to the new compositional possibilities afforded by notational innovations described by composer Philippe de Vitry (1291-1361) in his treatise Ars nova of 1322. While Ars nova music in this sense is best exemplified by repertoire such as the motets of the Roman de Fauvel, the use of the term has gradually been generalized to mean polyphonic music of the 14th century.
ars subtilior 1Compositional style of the late 14th century, rhythmically and melodically often highly refined with complex, florid textures.

Bis Diatessaron 1Interval of a double fourth, i.e. minor seventh.
bisection of musical intervals 2Dividing an interval in two equal halves. The ratio of the halved interval is the square root of the ratio of the given interval, usually an irrational value. It is impossible to divide an interval of a superparticular ratio, as 3:2 or 5:4, into equal parts with a rational ratio.
Boethius 1Late Roman statesman and philosopher (480-524 A.D.). His work De institutione musica (with its classification of music in musica mundana, musica humana and musica instrumentalis) became highly influential in the Middle Ages after having been all but forgotten until the ninth century.
chords 1A chord (from accord) is a set of tones sounding simultaneously. 
chroma 1Humans perceive pitches to have a similar tone colour when the space between them is one or more octaves. This perceived pitch property is referred to as chroma (in German: Tonigkeit).

Diatessaron 1The interval of a fourth
diatonic scale 11The diatonic scale includes five whole and two half steps in an octave. The half steps are separated by either two or three whole steps.
dissonance 1The sounding together of non-consonant intervals. In Pythagorean theory, any ratio composed of numbers greater than four was considered a dissonance. In polyphonic writing, specific rules for preparation and resolution govern the use of dissonances. Definitions and uses of dissonances changed over time and through different musical styles.

Glareanus 1Swiss music theorist (1488-1563). He is above all noted for his work Dodecachordon (published in 1547) in which he presented a theory of twelve tonal modes.
Greek tetrachords 4Four-tone. A pitch system contained within a perfect fourth. In ancient Greek theory, the three genera are determined by the spacing of the notes; diatonic (half-tone/whole-tone/whole-tone), chromatic (half-tone/half-tone/minor third) and enharmonic (quarter-tone/quarter-tone/major third). In modern theory and teaching, tetrachords are often used to point out the structure of major, minor and modal scales within the octave.

hexachords 7A hexachord is a part of a diatonic scale with six notes (ut, re, mi, fa, sol, la) covering a major sixth, where a central semitone is symmetrically flanked by two whole tones on both sides. The hexachord G-A-B-C-D-E is called Hexachordon duris, the hexachord F-G-A-Bb-C-D is called Hexachordon mollis, and the hexachord C-D-E-F-G-A is called Hexachordon naturalis. This system of three congruent hexachords goes back to Guido of Arezzo (992-1050).

just intonation 1A tuning system in which the relations between two notes can be expressed by ratios of small whole numbers with the octave corresponding to the ratio 2:1, the fifth to 3:2, the fourth to 4:3, the major third to 5:4. While the ratios of the octave, the fifth and the fourth correspond to the Pythagorean tuning system, the major third there has a ratio of 81:64, since every whole tone has the ratio 9:8. However, with the ratio of the third being 5:4 in just intonation, the whole tone is 10:9 rather than 9:8, so that there are two different whole tone ratios in just intonation.

major triad 3Chord stacking three tones in thirds. The basic structure of the major triad is root-major third-minor third, thus in C: C-E-G, its first inversion E-G-C and the second inversion G-C-E.
mesolabio 3Mechanical tool for constructing geometric sequences. It can be used to divide a musical interval ratio into any number of equal parts. Its functioning is based on similar triangles. 
microintervals 1Intervals smaller than a diatonic half tone. Any division of the octave into more than 12 steps leads to microintervals.
microtones 3The tones within any tuning system dividing the octave into more than 12 steps are generally called microtones, although it may be more precise to refer to microintervals between these tones, since these make up the microtonal system.
minor sixth 1Interval of eight half-tones (e.g. c-a flat). The major sixth equals nine half-tones.
minor triad 1Chord stacking three tones in thirds. The basic structure of the major triad is root-minor third-major third, thus in a: A-C-E, its first inversion C-E-A and the second inversion E-A-C.

n-tet 1Tone system dividing the octave into n steps.
octave 2Interval with the ratio 2:1. Expressed as frequencies, one octave above a tone is double, one octave below half its frequency.
octave replica 3
octave similarity 1Octave similarity refers to the phenomenon that tones an octave apart are perceived as similar, as are whole melodies played an octave apart. When played together, tones at one or more octaves apart seem to fit into one sound since the frequency an octave above a sound is double, an octave below a sound half that sounds frequency. 
overtones 2Overtones are the frequencies occurring above the fundamental frequency of a sound. The overtones influence the colour of a sound, the timbre. The fundamental and the overtones are the partials of a sound.
perfect consonance 1In polyphonic music practice, the unison, perfect fourth, perfect fifth and octave are generally considered perfect consonances, while the third and sixth (minor and major) are imperfect consonances. Historically, there have been different definitions in music theory (for example, theorist Johannes de Garlandia in the 13th century considered the unison and the octave perfect consonances).

Pythagorean comma 8In Pythagorean tuning the small interval between two (enharmonically identical) notes such as F sharp and G flat. First mentioned by Euclid, the ratio of the Pythagorean comma is 531441:524288, which is approx. 23, 46 cents. In Pythagorean tuning, the comma is also expressed by the difference between twelve fifths and seven octaves, the difference between a chromatic half tone and a diatonic half tone (limma), the difference between twelve fifths and seven octaves and the difference between three ditones (major thirds) and an octave.
Pythagorean diatonic scale 7
Pythagorean diatonic tone system 4
Pythagorean number system 2The numbers containing only the prime factors 2 and 3, i.e. numbers of the format 2^m*3^n with non-negative integers m and n.##Boethius (c. 480 - c. 525) represented these numbers as a triangular matrix. If negative power indices are admitted, the numbers of this format form a multiplicative mathematical group, which can be canonically represented in a two-dimensional grid.
Pythagorean semitone 4The Pythagorean tone system has two distinct semitones. The Pythagorean diatonic half tone is defined as the quotient of the fourth (4:3) and the Pythagorean major third (81:64), thus (4:3):(81:64)= 256:243 or approx. 90, 2 cents. The Pythagorean chromatic semitones (also known as Pythagorean apotome) ratio is 2187:2048 or approx. 113, 7 cents. It is expressed by the difference between four octaves and seven pure fifths. The difference between these semitones is the Pythagorean comma.
quarter tone 1Interval that is a quarter of a whole-tone. In tempered tuning, the interval is 50 cents.
quinario 1Italian five-syllable verse. ##The set of numbers {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}, cf. Tetraktys and senario.
Quinque toni continui 1A stack of five major tones of the ratio 9:8. The difference of an octave and five major tones consists of two Pythagorean diatonic semitones of the ratio 256:243, an interval being a Pythagorean comma smaller than a major tone.
Schisma 1The interval between a Pythagorean comma and a syntonic comma. Its ratio is 32805:32768, which corresponds to 1.9537 cents. For Glareanus (1488-1563) the Schisma is half a Pythagorean comma and Ren Descartes (1596-1650) called the Syntonic comma 81:80 a Schisma.
semitone 1Half-tone. The smallest tone step in 12-tet tuning.
senario 2Italian verse with six syllables. ##The set of numbers {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6}. It is an extension of the Pythagorean tetraktys {1, 2, 3, 4} and used by Gioseffo Zarlino (1517-1590) to justify the thirds 5:4 and 6:5 as consonances. The problem with the senario is that it contains the major sixth 5:3 but not the minor sixth 8:5.
Sesquidecimasettima3The ratio 18:17. This ratio is close to the ratio of the semitone in 12-tet: Twelve semitones of the ratio 18:17 are about half a Pythagorean comma (12.5 cents) smaller than an octave. ##The Sesquidecimasettima was proposed by Vincenzo Galilei (1520-1591) for tuning the lute.
similar triangles 1Two triangles of the same shape, i.e. with equal angles, are called similar triangles. Similar triangles have equal ratios of side lengths.
solmization 10Solmization is the practice of associating syllables with pitches. It can be used as a means to teach and memorize melodies or to demonstrate and practice pitch structures. In Western music, the practice is generally ascribed to theorist Guido of Arezzo (992 to 1050 A.D.), assigning the pitches in a hexachord the syllables ut, re, mi, fa, sol, la. Later, the system was expanded to cover the octave. Also, in addition to the relative system (i.e. syllables corresponding to pitch structures, but not necessarily to absolute pitches), systems with reference to absolute pitches were adopted.
spiral 3
staff 1In modern Western music, a notational space consisting of five horizontal lines and four spaces, each usually representing an absolute pitch. In some cases, the lines may also have a different function, such as to indicate the use of certain instruments (for percussion instruments) or the length of musical rests. Historically, first examples are found in diastematic Aquitanian neumes with one staff line. The use of four staff lines is attributed to Guido dArezzo (990 to 1050 A.D.).
superparticular ratio 4Ratio where the greater number exceeds the smaller by one unit, e.g. 2:1, 3:2, 4:3.
syntonic chromatic scale 15A chromatic scale with (at least) 12 pitches per octave taken from the syntonic tone system and corresponding to the 12-tet pitches. Because of the ambiguities of the syntonic tone system there are many different ways to select 12 pitches forming a chromatic scale. Johannes Kepler (1571-1630), Marin Mersenne (1588-1648), Isaac Newton (1643-1727), William Holder (1616-1698) and Leonhard Euler (1707-1783) offered structurally different syntonic chromatic scales with twelve pitch classes. Lodovico Fogliano (c. 1475-1542) and Francisco Salinas (1513-1590) give a syntonic chromatic scale with 14 pitch classes. Salinas also proposes a scale with 24 pitch classes, and Arthur von Oettingen (1826-1920) suggests an overarching syntonic system of 53 pitch classes.
syntonic comma 9Small interval of approximately 21.51 cents. It corresponds to the difference between a Pythagorean major third (81:64) and a just major third (5:4).
syntonic diatonic scale 13In the 16th and 17th century, two forms of syntonic diatonic scales were considered T-t-S-T-t-T-S and t-T-S-T-t-T-S, where T = major tone 9:8, t = minor tone 10:9 and S = semitone 16:15.##The former, proposed by Zarlino, contains three major triads of the ratio 4:5:6, and the latter, preferred by Descartes, contains three minor triads of the ratio 10:12:15. However, Descartes also suggests a diatonic scale with an ambiguous second degree.##Newton gives a syntonic diatonic scale with the structure T-t-S-t-T-T-S containing a Pythagorean third between the fifth and the seventh degree of the scale.
syntonic enharmonic tetrachord 1Gioseffo Zarlino (1517-1590) interpreted the enharmonic tetrachord as the syntonic proportion 300:375:384:400, i.e. by numbers containing the prime factors 2, 3 and 5 only.
syntonic intervals 1Musical intervals whose ratios can be expressed with the prime factors 2, 3 and 5.
syntonic tone system 3Tone system using the perfect fifth (3:2) and third (5:4) as generators, i.e. the pitches of a scale are found by stacking perfect fifths and thirds and subtracting octaves to get the absolute pitch.
temperament 6Any tuning system wherein intervals are adapted so that while pure intonation is given up they conform to specific tuning requirements. For example, pianos today are mostly tuned according to the segmentation of the octave into twelve equal half-tones, so that all keys can be played with the same tuning.
tetrachord 1Four-tone. A pitch system contained within a perfect fourth. In ancient Greek theory, the three genera are determined by the spacing of the notes; diatonic (half-tone/whole-tone/whole-tone), chromatic (half-tone/half-tone/minor third) and enharmonic (quarter-tone/quarter-tone/major third). In modern theory and teaching, tetrachords are often used to point out the structure of major, minor and modal scales within the octave.
Tetraktys 10Triangular figure with mathematical, geometrical and mystical significance in Pythagorean thought. It has four rows containing one point (first row), two points (second row), three points (third row) and four points (fourth row). It is thought that Pythagoras obtained the ratios for the basic intervals in the Pythagorean system from the tetractys: 2:1 (octave), 4:3 (perfect fourth), 3:2 (perfect fifth).

transposition 1Playing or notating music at a different pitch, i.e. moving all the pitches of a melody by a certain interval (e.g. C-D-C/E-F sharp-E). Geometrically, this corresponds to a translation in the pitch domain.
trinity 2The divine unity of Father, Son and Holy Ghost in God. The concept was developed by the church between the fourth and seventh century and has been interpreted and developed by theorists and theologians through the centuries.
Tritonus 1Tritonus or tritone, musical interval containing three whole tones, e.g. f-b. Although it is thus defined as an augmented fourth, a diminished fifth is generally also considered a tritonus in tempered tuning. Due to its instable harmonic character and having been forbidden in Guido of Arezzos hexachord system laid out in the 11th century, it has at times also been called diabolus in musica (devil in music) in earlier music practices up to the 16th century, while in later functional-harmonic styles it often takes on a strong dominant function with its possible resolution to the tonic and the third.
tuning 8Tuning relates on the one hand to tuning systems defining pitches within the system (e.g. Pythagorean tuning etc.). On the other hand, it denotes the act of mechanically tuning an instrument (e.g. a string) to certain pitches.
whole tone 1Interval of a whole tone, e.g. C-D, E-F sharp. The whole tone scale consists of six tones within the octave. The syntonic tone system has two different whole tones, the major tone of the ratio 9:8 and the minor tone 10:9, whereas the ratio of the whole tone in the Pythagorean tone system is 9:8.
